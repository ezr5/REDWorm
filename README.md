# REDWorm
## Introduction
REDWorm is a tool developed in Python that facilitates the analysis of _C.elegans_ images for scientific studies through a GUI. It works with file folders, i.e. the input of the program is always a folder. This can directly contain different TIFF files of the segmented _C.elegans_ or be made up of subfolders. In this way, the application automates several processes, including obtaining skeletons, generating CSV files with relevant data and creating graphs to visualise the results. 
## Requirements
- The files to be analysed must be in TIFF format.
- These files have to correspond to the C.elegans segmentation obtained from the in vivo microscopy images.
- The files have to be stored in a folder.
